# Terraform AWS GitHub CI

A Terraform module to setup a serverless GitHub CI build environment with pull
request and build status support using AWS CodeBuild.

## Architecture

![Architecture][1]

  [1]: assets/architecture.png

This module registers a GitHub webhook which is triggered for `push` and
`pull_request` events and starts the build for the respective branch. All
builds run in parallel. The build progress and status for a respective commit
is reported back to GitHub.

### Cost

Building with this CI server is unbelievably cheap - you only pay what you use.
Pricings starts at **$ 0,005 per build minute**, and AWS CodeBuild offers 100
free build minutes every month. The price for the other services (Lambda, SNS,
S3 and CloudWatch) are negligible and should only add a few cents to your
monthly bill. Compare that to the $ 69 that services like Travis cost every
month, regardless of how much you use them.

## Usage

You need an AWS and GitHub account and a repository you want to be built. The
repository must specify a `buildspec.yml` which is documented [here][2]. First,
you need to go to the [CodeBuild][3] dashboard in your region, manually create
a new project and choose GitHub as the **Source provider**, allowing AWS to
authorize your account. Next, [set up your AWS credentials][4] and
[install Terraform][5] if you haven't got it available already.

  [2]: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-spec-ref.htm
  [3]: https://console.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/home
  [4]: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/de_de/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html
  [5]: https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html

Next, add the following module to your Terraform configuration and apply it:

``` hcl
module "github_ci" {
  source  = "github.com/squidfunk/terraform-aws-github-ci"
  version = "0.6.0"

  namespace          = "<namespace>"
  github_owner       = "<owner>"
  github_repository  = "<repository>"
  github_oauth_token = "<oauth-token>"
}
```

All resources are prefixed with the value specified as `namespace`. If the S3
bucket name (see below) is not explicitly set, it's set to the given `namespace`
which means there must not already exist an S3 bucket with the same name. This
is a common source of error.

Now, when you push to `master`, or create a pull request, CodeBuild will
automatically build the commit and report the status back to GitHub. A status
badge can be added to your project's README using the `codebuild_badge_url` and
`codebuild_url` outputs printed to the terminal.

**Note**: the OAuth-token is currently mandatory (also for public repositories),
because Terraform doesn't support conditional blocks inside resources. However,
this feature is currently [being implemented][6] and should be released shortly.
If you want to omit it, create your own CodeBuild project [see below][7].

## Configuration

The following variables can be configured:

### Required

#### `namespace`

- **Description**: AWS resource namespace/prefix (lowercase alphanumeric)
- **Default**: `none`

#### `github_owner`

- **Description**: GitHub repository owner
- **Default**: `none`

#### `github_repository`

- **Description**: GitHub repository name
- **Default**: `none`

#### `github_oauth_token`

- **Description**: GitHub OAuth token for repository access
- **Default**: `none`

### Optional

#### `github_reporter`

- **Description**: GitHub commit status reporter
- **Default**: `"AWS CodeBuild"`

#### `codebuild_project`

- **Description**: CodeBuild project name (won't create [default project][7])
- **Default**: `""`
- **Conflicts with**: `codebuild_compute_type`, `codebuild_image`,
  `codebuild_buildspec`

  [7]: #default-project

#### `codebuild_compute_type`

- **Description**: Compute resources used by the build
- **Default**: `"BUILD_GENERAL1_SMALL"`
- **Conflicts with**: `codebuild_project`

#### `codebuild_image`

- **Description**: Base image for provisioning (AWS Registry, Docker)
- **Default**: `"aws/codebuild/ubuntu-base:14.04"`
- **Conflicts with**: `codebuild_project`

#### `codebuild_buildspec`

- **Description**: Build specification file location ([file format][2])
- **Default**: `"buildspec.yml"` (at repository root)
- **Conflicts with**: `codebuild_project`

#### `codebuild_privileged_mode`

- **Description**: If set to true, enables running the Docker daemon inside a
                   Docker container.
- **Default**: `false`
- **Conflicts with**: `codebuild_project`

#### `codebuild_bucket`

- **Description**: S3 bucket to store status badge and artifacts
- **Default**: `"${var.namespace}"` (equal to namespace)

#### `codebuild_environment_variables`
- **Description**: CodeBuild Environment variables
- **Deafult**: []
- **Conflicts with**: `codebuild_project`

### Outputs

The following outputs are exported:

#### `codebuild_service_role_name`

- **Description**: CodeBuild service role name

#### `codebuild_service_role_arn`

- **Description**: CodeBuild service role ARN

#### `codebuild_bucket`

- **Description**: CodeBuild artifacts bucket name

#### `codebuild_badge_url`

- **Description**: CodeBuild status badge URL

#### `codebuild_url`

- **Description**: CodeBuild project URL

### Default project

If you need more control over the CodeBuild project, you can pass the name of
an external CodeBuild project in this variable. This will avoid the creation
of the default project which has the following configuration:

``` hcl
resource "aws_codebuild_project" "codebuild" {
  name = "${var.github_repository}"

  build_timeout = "5"
  service_role  = "${aws_iam_role.codebuild.arn}"

  source {
    type     = "GITHUB"
    location = "https://github.com/$${owner}/$${repository}.git"

    auth {
      type     = "OAUTH"
      resource = "${var.github_oauth_token}"
    }
  }

  environment {
    compute_type = "${var.codebuild_compute_type}"
    type         = "LINUX_CONTAINER"
    image        = "${var.codebuild_image}"
  }

  artifacts {
    type           = "S3"
    location       = "${var.codebuild_bucket}"
    name           = "${var.github_repository}"
    namespace_type = "BUILD_ID"
    packaging      = "ZIP"
  }
}
```

The corresponding service role and the bucket are always created and exported
as `codebuild_service_role_arn`, `codebuild_service_role_name` and
`codebuild_bucket`. You can reference them in your CodeBuild resource
definition, e.g. to attach further policies, and thus avoid the creation of
your own service role and bucket.

## Limitations

This module first integrated with AWS CodePipeline but switched to CodeBuild,
because the former is heavily opinionated in terms of configuration and much,
much slower. For this reason, the deployment of your build artifacts must be
handled by another module which can be triggered when the build artifacts are
written to S3, most likely by [using a Lambda function][8].
